First attempt to train the model, using whisper-tiny
### BiggerModel.ipynb
Template to train Whisper-small, with adjusted hyperparameters
### FernanTraining.ipynb
Actual result of training the Whisper-Small model
### ModelComparison.ipynb
Comparison between Wisper-tiny, Wisper-Small, and baseline. Testing functinality to add to the final notebook
### Whisper_Guarani.ipynb
